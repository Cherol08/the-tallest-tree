# The Tallest Tree

This is a node.js application with a react frontend.


This application allows users to submit their height(m) through the tallest tree website and
stores them in a mongoBD database. Once submitted, the user will be sent an email informing
them of their new submission which also includes a list of previous submitted heights and the
average of all of submissions.
